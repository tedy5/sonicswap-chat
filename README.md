# SonicSwap AI Trading Assistant

## üèÜ Sonic DeFAI Hackathon Submission

This project is submission for the Sonic DeFAI Hackathon competition. I've built an integrated AI Trading Assistant that operates on the Sonic Network.

## üöÄ Overview

SonicSwap is a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sonic Network. While the full DEX interface is under development, our AI Trading Assistant is fully operational, allowing users to perform trades, analyze markets, and manage their crypto assets through natural language conversation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### AI Trading Assistant

- **Token Swaps**: Easily swap tokens on Sonic Network with simple commands like "Swap 1 S to USDC"
- **Bridge Functionality**: Bridge tokens between Sonic Network and other chains with commands like "Bridge 10 POL from Polygon to Sonic"
- **Contract Balance Management**: Deposit and withdraw tokens from the assistant's contract
  - Deposit: "Deposit 5 S into the contract"
  - Withdraw: "Withdraw my USDC from the contract"
- **Limit Orders**: Set up to 10 limit orders with commands like "Set a limit order to buy S at 0.45 USDC"
- **Market Analysis**: Get real-time price data and trend analysis for any token with "Analyze S price trends"
- **Custom Token Management**: Add custom tokens to your wallet with "Add USDC to my wallet"

### Coming Soon

- Advanced trading interface with charts and depth visualization
- Liquidity pools with competitive yield farming opportunities
- Advanced aggregator for highest return swaps with minimal slippage
- Governance token and DAO participation
